git-branch-tools
================

A set of git tools to help manage branches better. Some of the tools use
git-config hooks for local customization, have a look at the tools directly.

Archiving branches 
------------------
Sometimes branches are not actively developed anymore but need to be
preserved for posterity. These branches are clogging up the branch view.

    git archive-branch mybranch

moves `mybranch` to `archive/2013/mybranch` and tags the current top commit
with a message containing bits of the branch history.

Showing recent branches
-----------------------
Working on many branches can mean you forget which branch you worked on last
week, or the week before.

    git recent-branches

lists the various branches checked out over the history, including the date
and last commit date on that branch.  

Example:

    next                                          4 hours ago          last commit 6 days ago
    server-1.13-branch                            4 hours ago          last commit 2 weeks ago
    touch-grab-race-condition-56578-v2            3 days ago           last commit 3 days ago
    touch-grab-race-condition-56578               4 days ago           last commit 6 days ago      †
    bug/xts-segfaults                             6 days ago           last commit 6 days ago      †
    master                                        6 days ago           last commit 3 weeks ago
    for-keith                                     10 days ago          last commit 2 weeks ago
    memleak                                       13 days ago          last commit 2 weeks ago


### Dependencies

git-recent-branches requires GitPython: http://pythonhosted.org/GitPython/

Better branch descriptions
--------------------------
Can't remember what branch "fix-race-condition" was? Me neither. That's what

    git branch-description [branchname] [upstream]

will tell you. If upstream is given, it'll also show you what has been
merged into upstream already (by patch, not by commit).

And install the `git-post-checkout-nagging-hook` as your
`.git/hooks/post-checkout` to make sure you get reminded to set the branch
description.

Creating patch sets
-------------------
A wrapper around git-format-patch, that drops the patches into a directory
named after the patch set and date.

    $> git patch-set origin/master..HEAD~2
    $> ls patches
    patches/patches-2013-08-30-10:47-origin\master..HEAD~2/
    patches/latest -> patches/patches-2013-08-30-10:47-origin\master..HEAD~2/
 
patches/latest always links to the last generated patcheset.

Note: git-patch-set will run the pre-push hook (if any). Ideally, you'll
have a pre-push hook that runs make check, so you never send out patches
that haven't at least be built and tested.

    $> cat .git/hooks/pre-push
    cat ~/code/libevdev/.git/hooks/pre-push
    #!/bin/bash
    set -e
    echo "running make check"
    make check

Splitting commits
-----------------
During rebase, when you realise that a commit needs to be broken up into
two.

    $> git rebase -i
    # mark commit to split as "edit"
    $> git split-commit

The tool now calls git add -p, letting you add the hunks needed (and/or missing
files). Finish up, it will re-commit with the same message and drop you
back to the shell to finish up and continue. Alternatively,

    $> git split-commit --after
    
will drop you into a shell immediately, letting you git add and commit
anything you want committed _before_ the current commit. Exiting the shell
will commit the rest.

Squashing commits
-----------------
git config's rebase.autosquash enables automatic re-ordering and squashing
of commits starting with "squash!" or "fixup!", followed by a subject line
that matches an earlier commit.

git-squash is a wrapper script around that to make it easier to remember.

    $> git add myfile yourfile
    $> git squash
    [1] this is the most recent commit
    [2] previos commit
    [3] some other commit
    [4] a commit message
    Number to squash in: 3

Arguments passed to git-squash will be passed to git-commit.


Adding tags to commit messages
------------------------------
Some projects request Reviewed-by, Signed-off-by or bugzilla references to
be adeed to a commit message. git-add-tag is a script to add these to a set
of commit messages.

    $> git add-tag HEAD~6..

This will open up an editor window. Write the line you need to add to the
commit range and exit. The line will be appended to all commits in the
range.
